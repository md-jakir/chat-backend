## Architecture Overview

### Overview

The chatbot_boilerplate project is designed to provide a structured and scalable foundation for building a chatbot application. It follows a modular architecture, ensuring that different parts of the application are decoupled and can be developed and maintained independently.

### Components

1.  **App**: The core application logic resides here. This includes configuration, endpoints, helpers, models, repository, schema, services, and uploads.

    - **Config**: Configuration files for the application.
    - **Endpoints**: API endpoint definitions for interacting with the chatbot.
    - **Helpers**: Utility functions and helper classes.
    - **Models**: Database models and ORM mappings.
    - **Repository**: Data access layer for database interactions.
    - **Schema**: Data validation and serialization schemas.
    - **Services**: Business logic and service layer.
    - **Uploads**: Logic for handling file uploads.
    - **\_\_pycache\_\_**: Bytecode cache directory.
    - **db.py**: Database connection and session management.
    - **main.py**: Entry point for running the application.

2.  **Data**: Directory for storing data files and datasets used by the chatbot.
3.  **Env**: Environment configuration files.
4.  **Logs**: Directory for storing log files.
5.  **Models**: Pre-trained models or custom models used by the chatbot.
6.  **Prompts**: Pre-defined prompts and templates for the chatbot's responses.
7.  **Static**: Static files such as images, CSS, and JavaScript.
8.  **Utils**: Utility scripts and functions.
9.  **Environment and Configuration Files**:
    - **.env**: Environment variables.
    - **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
    - **alembic.ini**: Configuration file for Alembic (database migrations).
    - **docker-compose.yml**: Docker Compose configuration for setting up multi-container Docker applications.
    - **Dockerfile**: Instructions for building the Docker image.
    - **Greet_users.py**: Script for greeting users.
    - **last_update_timestamp.txt**: File to keep track of the last update timestamp.
    - **LICENSE**: License file.
    - **README.md**: Project documentation and instructions.
    - **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies.

### Detailed Description

- **Endpoints**: This folder contains the API routes for the chatbot. Each endpoint corresponds to a specific functionality of the chatbot, allowing for clear separation of concerns and ease of maintenance.
- **Services**: The services layer handles the business logic of the application. This is where the core functionality of the chatbot is implemented, such as processing user input, generating responses, and interacting with external APIs.
- **Models and Repository**: These folders manage the database interactions. Models define the structure of the data, while the repository layer provides an abstraction over the database operations, making it easier to manage and test.
- **Config**: Contains configuration settings, including database connections, API keys, and other environment-specific settings. This ensures that configuration is centralized and easily manageable.
- **Helpers and Utils**: Utility functions and helper classes that provide common functionalities used throughout the application. This helps in reducing code duplication and promoting code reuse.

**Prompts and Static**: Prompts folder contains pre-defined prompt templates that the chatbot can use.

<!-- Create a virtual environment:
`py -3.11 -m venv env`

Activate the virtual environment:
`env\Scripts\activate`

Run these commands:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`uvicorn app.main:app` -->

## Running the Application

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   py -3.11 -m venv env
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On Unix or MacOS:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

### Additional Steps

1. **Run Migrations**: Apply database migrations using Alembic.

   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. **Docker Setup**: Alternatively, use Docker to containerize the application.
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
